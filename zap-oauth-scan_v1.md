Great! Let's break down each line of this **GitHub Actions workflow** as if you're mentoring a junior dev, using clear but professional explanations:

---

```yaml
jobs:
  zap_oauth_scan:
```
ðŸ’¬ **Defines a job** named `zap_oauth_scan` in the GitHub Actions workflow.  
Think of a job as a pipeline step that runs independently to complete a task, like testing or deploying.

---

```yaml
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```
ðŸ’¬ This job will **run on the latest Ubuntu virtual machine** that GitHub provides in its hosted runners.  
Itâ€™s like giving you a fresh Linux computer in the cloud, ready to install software and run commands.

---

```yaml
    steps:
```
ðŸ’¬ Steps are the **individual tasks** within a job.  
Each step is like a command in a script â€“ run one after another inside the jobâ€™s environment.

---

```yaml
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
```
ðŸ’¬ This step uses a prebuilt action to **pull your repositoryâ€™s code into the workflow runner**.  
Without this, the workflow has no access to your source files (e.g., `main.py`, `get-token.sh`).

---

```yaml
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
```
ðŸ’¬ Prepares the runner by installing **Python 3.11** using GitHubâ€™s official setup action.  
This ensures compatibility with your FastAPI app and dependencies.

---

```yaml
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install fastapi uvicorn "python-jose[cryptography]" pydantic
        sudo apt-get install jq
```
ðŸ’¬ Installs Python packages needed for your FastAPI app to run, including:
- `fastapi`: the web framework
- `uvicorn`: the ASGI server
- `python-jose`: to handle JWT tokens (commonly used in OAuth2 flows)
- `pydantic`: for data validation

Also installs `jq`, a CLI tool for processing JSON â€” useful for extracting tokens later.

---

```yaml
    - name: Start FastAPI app
      run: |
        uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
        sleep 5
```
ðŸ’¬ Starts your FastAPI app on port 8000 **in the background** using `uvicorn`.  
Then waits 5 seconds (`sleep 5`) to ensure the server has enough time to fully start before the next steps execute.

---

```yaml
    - name: Get Bearer Token
      run: bash get-token.sh
```
ðŸ’¬ Executes a shell script (`get-token.sh`) that likely performs an OAuth2 login and saves a **Bearer token** to a file (`token.txt`).  
This token will be used for authenticated scanning in the next step.

---

```yaml
    - name: Run ZAP Scan with Bearer Token
      uses: zaproxy/action-full-scan@v0.10.0
```
ðŸ’¬ Runs the **ZAP full scan** GitHub Action, which launches OWASP ZAP to spider and attack your app for security issues.

---

```yaml
      with:
        target: 'http://localhost:8000/protected'
```
ðŸ’¬ Specifies the **target URL** for scanning â€” here, itâ€™s a protected route that requires authentication.

---

```yaml
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
ðŸ’¬ Required for permission to run GitHub actions and access internal resources like uploading artifacts or commenting on PRs.  
*This is not your OAuth2 Bearer token.*

---

```yaml
        fail_action: false
```
ðŸ’¬ Tells the workflow **not to fail** even if the ZAP scan finds high-severity issues.  
Useful for testing or demoing without breaking the CI pipeline.

---

```yaml
        cmd_options: '-config replacer.full_list(0).enabled=true ...
```
ðŸ’¬ This line injects the **Bearer token into HTTP requests** that ZAP sends by modifying the `Authorization` header using ZAPâ€™s replacer feature.

- `replacer.full_list(0).matchstring=Authorization`: looks for the `Authorization` header
- `replacement="Bearer $(cat token.txt)"`: replaces it with your dynamic token
- This allows ZAP to **scan as an authenticated user**, accessing protected routes.

---

```yaml
    - name: Upload ZAP report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```
ðŸ’¬ After scanning, this uploads the generated **ZAP report files** (like `report.html` and `report.json`) as artifacts.

---

```yaml
      with:
        name: zap-auth-report
        path: |
          *.html
          *.json
        if-no-files-found: warn
```
ðŸ’¬ Gives the artifact a name (`zap-auth-report`) and specifies which files to upload.  
If no reports are found, it will **warn** instead of failing the job.

---

## ðŸ§  Summary

This workflow:
1. Sets up a Python environment
2. Starts a FastAPI app
3. Authenticates via OAuth2 and extracts a token
4. Runs an authenticated ZAP scan using that token
5. Uploads a security report for later inspection

Would you like me to generate a sample `get-token.sh` for a typical OAuth2 login using curl?
