Absolutely! Here's a clear breakdown of this `get-token.sh` script, line by line, explained like you're guiding a junior developer but with technical precision:

---

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
💬 This is the **shebang**. It tells the system to use the **Bash shell** to interpret the script.  
All the lines below will be executed as Bash commands.

---

```bash
# Log in and extract token from JSON response
```
💬 This is a comment — it explains that the goal here is to **simulate a login** to your FastAPI OAuth2 endpoint and extract the resulting **access token**.

---

```bash
LOGIN_URL="http://localhost:8000/token"
```
💬 Sets a **Bash variable** called `LOGIN_URL`.  
This is the endpoint on your FastAPI app that **issues tokens**, typically under an OAuth2 password flow (`/token` route).

---

```bash
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST $LOGIN_URL \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=demo&password=secret")
```

💬 This block uses `curl` to **send a POST request** to the login endpoint, simulating a user submitting a login form.

- `-s`: silent mode (no progress bar or error messages)
- `-X POST`: specifies the HTTP method
- `-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`: sets the request header, simulating a form submission
- `-d "username=demo&password=secret"`: sends credentials in the request body
- The response (a JSON object containing the token) is stored in the `RESPONSE` variable.

➡️ *Example JSON returned:*
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

---

```bash
TOKEN=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '.access_token')
```
💬 Uses the `jq` command-line JSON parser to **extract the value of the `access_token`** from the JSON response.

- `echo $RESPONSE` pipes the JSON to `jq`
- `-r`: outputs raw string (no quotes)
- `.access_token`: targets the specific field

The result is stored in the `TOKEN` variable.

---

```bash
echo $TOKEN > token.txt
```
💬 Writes the access token to a file named `token.txt`.  
This file is then used by the GitHub Actions workflow (via ZAP's `replacer` config) to authenticate each request during scanning.

---

### 🧠 TL;DR Summary

This script:
1. **Logs in** to your FastAPI OAuth2 endpoint
2. **Parses the token** from the JSON response using `jq`
3. **Saves** that token to a file so it can be used by ZAP to run authenticated security scans

Would you like a version of this that works with a real OAuth2 provider like Auth0 or Keycloak too?
